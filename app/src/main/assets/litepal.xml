    <!--
        Define the database name of your application.
        By default each database name should be end with .db.
        If you didn't name your database end with .db,
        LitePal would plus the suffix automaticly for you.
        For example:
        <dbname value="demo" ></dbname>
    -->
    <dbname value="NetKnight" />

    <!--
        Define the version of your database. Each time you want
        to upgrade your database, the version tag would helps.
        Modify the models you defined in the mapping tag, and just
        make the version value plus one, the upgrade of database
        will be processed automaticly without concern.
            For example:
        <version value="1" ></version>
    -->
    <!--modify app table:add pkgname,ignore column icon-->
    <!--version 4:modify traffic table:change appId string to long-->
    <!--version 5:modify app table: add isAccessVpn boolean,change uid string to int-->
    <version value="5" />

    <!--
        Define your models in the list with mapping tag, LitePal will
        create tables for each mapping class. The supported fields
        defined in models will be mapped into columns.
        For example:
        <list>
            <mapping class="com.test.model.Reader"></mapping>
            <mapping class="com.test.model.Magazine"></mapping>
        </list>
    -->
    <list>

        <mapping class="com.pencilbox.netknight.model.App" />
        <mapping class="com.pencilbox.netknight.model.BlockIp" />
        <mapping class="com.pencilbox.netknight.model.BlockName" />
    </list>

    <!--
        Define where the .db file should be. "internal" means the .db file
        will be stored in the database folder of internal storage which no
        one can access. "external" means the .db file will be stored in the
        path to the directory on the primary external storage device where
        the application can place persistent files it owns which everyone
        can access. "internal" will act as default.
        For example:
        <storage value="external"></storage>
    -->
    <storage value="external" />
